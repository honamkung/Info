Curriculum Vitae: CV

I am a Senior Research Scientist at Google Brain Team working on scientific understanding of deep neural networks. I was in second-year cohort of the AI Residency program.

Before joining Google in 2017, my main research focus was on theoretical high-energy physics. I was a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Physics & Astronomy at University of British Columbia (UBC) in the String Theory Group. Before that, I completed my PhD in Center for Theoretical Physics (CTP) at MIT working on theoretical physics.
